                children under the age of 13 and take many special precautions
                to protect their privacy. We may require a child to disclose
                some Personal Information to use the Services. However, we do
                not require a child to disclose more information than is
                reasonably necessary to use the Services and Personal
                Information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other
                than those for which it was collected. Some of the information
                created or submitted by a child may be publicly available.
                Parents and legal guardians can review their child’s Personal
                Information, delete it, and refuse to allow any further
                collection or use of such information. We encourage parents and
                legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and
                to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never
                to provide Personal Information through the Services without
                their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal
                guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary
                precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to
                never give out Personal Information when online without their
                permission. We believe parents and legal guardians should be
                involved in the online activities of their children and suggest
                that parents do their best to provide their children with a safe
                and friendly online environment. Rules of Contest and

                your credit card details or other payment account information,
                which will be used solely for processing payments. We use
                third-party payment processors (“Payment Processors”) to assist
                us in processing your payment information securely.
                <br />
                Payment Processors adhere to the latest security standards as
                managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
                effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                Discover. Sensitive and private data exchange happens over a SSL
                secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected
                with digital signatures, and the Services are also in compliance
                with strict vulnerability standards in order to create as secure
                of an environment as possible for Users. We will share payment
                data with the Payment Processors only to the extent necessary
                for the purposes of processing your payments, refunding such
                payments, and dealing with complaints and queries related to
                such payments and refunds.
                <br />
                Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some
                Personal Information from you, which allows them to process your
                payments (e.g., your email address, address, credit card
                details, and bank account number) and handle all the steps in
                the payment process through their systems, including data
                collection and data processing. The Payment Processors’ use of
                your Personal Information is governed by their respective
                privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy
                protections as protective as this Policy. We suggest that you

                If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you
                have certain data protection rights and we aim to take
                reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or
                limit the use of your Personal Information. If you wish to be
                informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you
                want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us. In
                certain circumstances, you have the following data protection
                rights:
                <br />
                <br />
                (i) You have the right to withdraw consent where you have
                previously given your consent to the processing of your Personal
                Information. To the extent that the legal basis for our
                processing of your Personal Information is consent, you have the
                right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not
                affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
                <br />
                (ii) You have the right to learn if your Personal Information is
                being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain
                aspects of the processing, and obtain a copy of your Personal
                Information undergoing processing.
                <br />
                (iii) You have the right to verify the accuracy of your
                information and ask for it to be updated or corrected. You also
                have the right to request us to complete the Personal
                Information you believe is incomplete.
                <br />
                (iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your
                information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis
                other than consent. Where Personal Information is processed for
                the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
                vested in us, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests
                pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a
                ground related to your particular situation to justify the
                objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal
                Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can
                object to that processing at any time without providing any
                justification. To learn whether we are processing Personal
                Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the
                relevant sections of this Policy.
                <br />
                (v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict
                the processing of your Personal Information. These circumstances
                include: the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested
                by you and we must verify its accuracy; the processing is
                unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of your Personal
                Information and request the restriction of its use instead; we
                no longer need your Personal Information for the purposes of
                processing, but you require it to establish, exercise or defend
                your legal claims; you have objected to processing pending the
                verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your
                legitimate grounds. Where processing has been restricted, such
                Personal Information will be marked accordingly and, with the
                exception of storage, will be processed only with your consent
                or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal
                claims, for the protection of the rights of another natural, or
                legal person or for reasons of important public interest.
                <br />
                (vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain
                the erasure of your Personal Information from us. These
                circumstances include: the Personal Information is no longer
                necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected
                or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based
                processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of
                applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct
                marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully
                processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure
                such as where processing is necessary: for exercising the right
                of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a
                legal obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or
                defense of legal claims.
                <br />
                (vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information
                that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and
                machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it
                transmitted to another controller without any hindrance from us,
                provided that such transmission does not adversely affect the
                rights and freedoms of others.
                <br />
                (viii) You have the right to complain to a data protection
                authority about our collection and use of your Personal
                Information. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your
                complaint directly with us, you have the right to lodge a
                complaint with your local data protection authority. For more
                information, please contact your local data protection authority
                in the EEA. This provision is applicable provided that your
                Personal Information is processed by automated means and that
                the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you
                are part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
